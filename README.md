# C++ Chess
Console ASCII-Chess game written in C++.
Not really a full Chess game because there is no check-mate functionallity (King can be captured like normal figure :scream:). But the moves of all figures (including two special ones) are implemented and (i think) working.  
Apart from the "normal" multiplayer, there is also a automatic mode, where pure randomness completes a game.
